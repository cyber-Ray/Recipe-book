        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
            <li>16 ounce package Jimmy Dean pork breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>12 fluid ounces evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Combine 2 cups of flour with the baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl and whisk. Cut the shortening into a flour mixture with a pastry cutter until mixture is crumbly. Add the egg and milk and mix well. Lay dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Roll dough with a thickness of 3/4- to 1-inch, cut with a biscuit cutter, and place biscuits onto the baking sheet. Brush tops of the biscuits with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes until the biscuits are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, then drain excess grease. Stir the remaining butter into the sausage, and mix until the butter has melted. Then mix in 1/4 cup flour. Pour the evaporated milk and water into the mixture and bring gravy to a simmer. Once the gravy is simmering, reduce the heat to low, and allow the gravy to thicken for about 5 minutes. Once the gravy is thickened, add salt and black pepper to season to your preference.</li>
            <li>Pour the sausage gravy on top of the biscuits and serve.</li>
